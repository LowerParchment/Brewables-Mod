# 🧪 Brewables (Forge 1.20.1)

**Brewables** is a Minecraft Forge mod that replaces the traditional brewing stand with a more immersive and interactive potion brewing system using cauldrons, thrown ingredients, and a stirring rod.

## 🌟 Features (WIP)
- Use a **cauldron over a campfire** to brew potions
- Throw ingredients like **Nether Wart** into the cauldron
- Watch as the **water changes color** and bubbles with magic
- Use the **Stirring Rod** to activate and finalize brews
- Successful combinations yield **custom potions**
- Failed mixes produce a **Witch’s Wart** — a chaotic potion with randomized effects
- Extract finished potions into bottles

## 🎯 Why This Mod?
Vanilla brewing has always felt static and underwhelming. I wanted something more tactile and experimental — where the act of brewing feels magical, chaotic, and personal.

More importantly, this mod was inspired by my girlfriend, who missed the immersive brewing system from the old *Witchery* mod — which sadly no longer works in modern modpacks. Since we couldn’t bring that exact experience forward, I decided to recreate her favorite part of it in my own way, as a gift to her.

## 🛠️ Current Version
